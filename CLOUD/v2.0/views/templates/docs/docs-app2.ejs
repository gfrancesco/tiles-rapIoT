                <h2>Create and configure application context</h2>
                <p>
                    This step of the process involves using the TILES Cloud web portal to create the application context and configure the application
                    with the abstract TILES, or TILES placeholder devices, to be used in the application. The amount of TILES
                    Square modules to be used in your application should already have been identified in the previous step
                    of the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One important part of creating the application context in the web portal is to determine what
                    <a href="{{selectDevEnvUrl}}">development environment</a> to be used. The steps of defining the abstract
                    Square modules and configuring the application is identical for all development environments, but the
                    steps <a href="#/docs-app3">Application development</a> and
                    <a href="#/docs-app4">Application deployment</a> might vary, so please read the documentation about the
                    development environments before making your decision.
                </p>

                <h3>Creating a new application in TILES Cloud</h3>
                <p>
                    To create a new application, navigate to the <a href="/#/applications">applications</a> section of the
                    TILES Cloud admin portal. Here you will be able to see all registered applications, the application owners,
                    the number of TILES Squares and the development environment of the applications.
                </p>
                <div class="docs-img opacity75">
                    <img src="/images/howto/howto-list-applications.png" alt="list_applications" />
                    <br/>
                    <span>List of Applications in TILES Cloud web portal</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    By clicking the <b>Create new application</b> you will be prompted with the create application form.
                    This is where you will set the name of the application, select the development environment and select
                    the application owner. After filling the form, hit the <b>Create</b> button, and the application appear
                    in the list of applicaitons.
                </p>
                <div class="docs-img opacity75">
                    <img src="/images/howto/howto-create-application.png" alt="create_application" />
                    <br/>
                    <span>Add application form in TILES Cloud web portal</span>
                </div>
                <p class="text-signal-orange">
                    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign"></span> Make sure to select the appropriate
                    <a href="{{selectDevEnvUrl}}">development environment</a> for your application.
                </p>

                <h3>Defining abstract TILES Squares</h3>
                <p>
                    Once the application context has been created, we can configure the abstract TILES Squares by entering the application view.
                    This is done by selecting the application from the
                    <a href="/#/applications">list of applications</a>. In the application view we will have some options,
                    depeinding on the chosen development environment, and we will be able to administer the Abstract TILES.
                    Below we can see the 'garage_control_system' application that we just created. In the list of 'Abscract
                    TILES' we see that two TILES have been defined. By clicking the '+ new Abstract TILE' button and filling
                    out the abstract name, we will be able to create a new abstract TILE that will be appended to the list.
                </p>
                <div class="docs-img opacity75">
                    <img src="/images/howto/howto-add-abstract-tile.png" alt="add_abstract_tile" />
                    <br/>
                    <span>Add absctract TILES Squares to application in TILES Cloud web portal</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In the list of the Abstract TILES we will also be able to see the state of the physical TILE that we will pair with the abstract
                    TILE in the <a href="#/docs-app6">Device appropriation phase</a> of the process.
                    For now we are satisfied with defining all TILES Squares to be used and seeing the 'unpaired' keyword
                    in the list. You can revisit this step of the process at any time during application development to add
                    and remove Abstract TILES from your application as your idea evolves during development.
