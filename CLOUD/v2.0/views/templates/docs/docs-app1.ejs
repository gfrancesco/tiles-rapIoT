                <h2>Identifying number of TILES Squares</h2>

                <p>
                    This step of the <i>Application Development Process</i> is inteded after the idea generation phase. In
                    this step you will be identifying the number of TILES Square to be used in your application, and allocate
                    the Squares with the appropriate hardware configuration. This documentation explains two different approaches
                    to identify TILES Squares. The approach you choose depends on the idea generation phase you have employed
                    to develop your IoT application idea. The first and recomended approach listed below requires access
                    to the
                    <a href="{{tilestoolkitUrl}}/cards">TILES Card game</a>, while the second approach offers support without
                    following the structured IoT application idea generation process of the TILES Card game.

                <h3>Identify squares from TILES Cards</h3>
                <p>
                    By employing the TILES Cards idea generation process, identifying the number of TILES Squares is quite simple. In the TILES
                    Card game, every <b>THINGS card</b> represents a TILES Square in your application.
                    Below you see an example of four THINGS cards, each representing an individual TILES Square to be used
                    in your application.
                </p>

                    <span>THINGS Cards from TILES Cards</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    To identify what hardware capabilities the Squares must support, the
                    <b>HUMAN INTERACTION</b> cards will indicate the <b>input primitive</b> capabilities, while the
                    <b>FEEDBACK</b> cards indicate the <b>output primitive</b> to be supported by the Squares. The below
                    cards shows an example of these cards and mapping them to the appropriate THINGS will define the hardware
                    capabilities of the TILES Squares to be used in your application.

                    <span>HUMAN INTERACTIONS Cards and FEEDBACK Cards from TILES Cards</span>
                </div>

                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <p>
                    As an example, lets assume your idea generated with the TILES Cards contains the cards seen below with the following description:
                    <br/>
                    <i>Whenever the refridgerator door is opened, the plant in the livingroom should blink.</i>
                </p>
                <div class="docs-img docs-cards">
                    <img src="/images/tiles_cards/a-2.jpg" alt="tilt" />
                    <img src="/images/tiles_cards/t-10.jpg" alt="tap" />
                    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                    <img src="/images/tiles_cards/t-20.jpg" alt="light" />
                    <img src="/images/tiles_cards/f-7.jpg" alt="vibrate" />
                    <br/>
                    <span>WHEN refridgerator door is rotated THEN blink plant.</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In the example seen above we can identify <b>two</b> TILES Squares. One in the refridgerator door, and
                    one in the plant. The human interaction and feedback cards describes the capabilities of these Squares,
                    thus we will need:
                    <ul>
                        <li>One TILES Square supporting ROTATE as input primitive</li>
                        <li>One TILES Square supporting BLINK as output primitive</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Identifying squares without TILES Cards</h3>
                <p>
                    If you have not employed the TILES Card game for generating your IoT application idea, you can still identify the number
                    of TILES Squares needed in your application. Similarly to the approach above, you will need to identify
                    what things, or objects, you wish to use as smart devices in your application. For every smart object
                    in your IoT application you must allocate a TILES Square.
