                <h2>Identifying number of TILES Squares</h2>

                <p>
                    This step of the <i>Application Development Process</i> is inteded after the idea generation phase. In
                    this step, you will be identifying the number of TILES Square modules to be used in your application,
                    and allocate the Square modules with the appropriate hardware configuration. This documentation explains
                    two different approaches. The approach you choose, depends on the idea generation phase you have employed
                    to develop your IoT application idea. The first approach listed below requires access to the
                    <a href="{{tilestoolkitUrl}}/cards">TILES Card</a> game, while the second approach offers support
                    without following the structured IoT application idea generation process of the TILES Card game.

                    <a href="{{squarePrimitivesUrl}}">TILES Square primitive section</a> for more information on the different

                <h3>Identify squares from TILES Cards</h3>
                <p>
                    By employing the TILES Cards idea generation process, identifying the number of TILES Square modules is quite simple. In
                    the TILES Card game, every <b>THINGS card</b> represents a TILES Square module in
                    your application. Below you see an example of four THINGS cards, each representing an individual TILES
                    Square module to be used in your application.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    To identify what hardware capabilities the Square modules must support, the
                    <b>HUMAN INTERACTION</b> cards will indicate the <b>input primitive</b> capabilities, while the
                    <b>FEEDBACK</b> cards indicate the <b>output primitive</b> to be supported by the Square module. The
                    below cards shows an example of these cards and mapping them to the appropriate THINGS will define the
                    hardware capabilities of the TILES Square modules to be used in your application.

                <h3>Identifying squares without TILES Cards</h3>
                <p>
                    If you have not employed the TILES Card game for generating your IoT application idea, you can still identify the number
                    of TILES Square modules needed in your application. Similarly to the approach above, you will need to
                    identify what things, or objects, you wish to use as smart devices in your application. For every smart
                    object in your IoT application, you must allocate a TILES Square module.
