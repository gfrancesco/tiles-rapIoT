                <h2>Application interaction</h2>
                <p>
                    In this final step of the process, you are ready to use your application by interacting with the configured TILES Square
                    modules. By now you should have:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <a href="#/docs-app1">Identified modules</a> that you need in your application
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="#/docs-app2">Created application</a> and configured it in the TILES Cloud web portal
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="#/docs-app3">Developed application</a> in the chosen development environment
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="#/docs-app4">Deployed application</a> to run outside development
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="#/docs-app5">Appropriated application</a> by configuring a gateway to run your application
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="#/docs-app6">Appropriated devices</a> by pairing abstract and physical devices in your
                            application.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the application intails interacting with the TILES Square modules to prduce the desired input and output events for
                    the connected Square modules and digital services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a final note, it is important to remember that application development such as this often requires to revisit some of
                    development. If you discover some inconsistency with the behavior of your application, you might need
                    to revisit some of the steps of the <i>Application Development Process</i>. Additionally,
                    if you later want to extend your application, it is possible to do so by performing a new iteration of
                    the process in order to change or extend the application capabilities.
