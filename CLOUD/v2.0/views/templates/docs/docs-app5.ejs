                <p>
                    In this step of the process you will be writing the actual program code of your application. This is the most complex step
                    of the process and has been divided into four substeps for you to follow. Do not worry if this is the
                    first time writing program code as this documentation will guide you through every step of the development
                    process. The four steps are:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Map HUMAN ACTIONS cards with TILES API events</li>
                        <li>Map FEEDBACK cards with TILES API commands</li>
                        <li>Map SERVICES cards with TILES API sources</li>
                        <li>Use TILES API for additional application behavior</li>
                    </ol>
                    The first thing you need to do is to visit the section relevant for your development environment below.
                </p>
                <h3>Cloud Development Environment</h3>
                <p>
                    If you selected the Cloud Development Environment, you will be writing your program code in JavaScript. At this point you
                    should have the Cloud Development Environment running as described in the
                    <a href="{{prevUrl()}}">previous step</a> of the process.
                    <br/>

                    <b>
                    The <a href="#/docs-js1">JavaScript API</a> will guide you through the steps of prototyping your IoT application.
                </b>
                </p>
                <h3>Local Development Environment</h3>
                <p>
                    If you selected the Local Development Environment, you will be writing your program code in JavaScript. You should have downloaded
                    the JavaScript API and have your favorite IDE running on your local computer, as explained in the
                    <a href="{{prevUrl()}}">previous step</a> of the process.
                    <br/>

                </p>
                <h3>Rule Engine Development Environment</h3>
                <p>
                    If you selected the Rule Engine Development Environment, you will not be writing your application code textually. Instead
                    you will be defining rules that will connect your physical objects together.
