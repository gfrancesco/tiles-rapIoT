                <h2>TILES toolkit Application Development Process</h2>

                <p>
                    If you have just generated an IoT application idea and you are looking for a way to rapidly transform your idea into a working
                    prototype based on everyday object augmentation, you should keep on reading about the
                    <i>TILES toolkit Application Development Process</i> (ADP). The ADP is a process inteded to guide IoT
                    applicaiton developers through the required steps of prototyping a fully functional IoT application using
                    the TILES toolkit. Whether you are a non-expert or an expert user, this section will enable you to rapidly
                    transform your IoT applicaiton ideas into working prototypes with hardware components, message events
                    and running program code in no time.

                    <br/><br/> An illustration of the ADP and a short description of the defined steps can be seen below.
                    Go through each subsection of the documentation sequentially and you will have a working prototype of
                    your IoT application operable in just a few moments. Developing IoT applicatinos have never been easier!

                            configuration for each thing. (Idea generation could also occur without TILES Cards).</td>
