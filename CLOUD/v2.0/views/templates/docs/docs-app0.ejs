                <p>
                    The <i>Application Development Process</i> of the TILES toolkit, can be seen on the figure below. This
                    process is intended to guide the application developer through the steps of developing a fully functional
                    IoT application. This section of the documentation will explain each step of the process which is sumarized
                    in the following table.

                            configuration for each thing. (Idea generation could also occur without TILES Cards).</td>
