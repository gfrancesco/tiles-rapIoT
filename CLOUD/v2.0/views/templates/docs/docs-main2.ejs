                    To start developing with the TILES toolkit, you need at least one TILES Square module, and a smartphone running the TILES
                    Gateway app. The Gateway will be able to discover the Square module(s), connect to them, and convey the
                    events to and from the module(s) over the Internet. In addition you need an internet connection and an
                    internet enabled device for navigating the TILES Cloud web portal, and developing your application.
                </p>

                    Please visit the <a href="{{tilestoolkitUrl}}">TILES toolkit homepage</a> for instructions on how
                    to acquire TILES Square modules, TILES Cards and TILES Gateway.

                    If you want to extend the TILES Square firmware, you will also need to download the
